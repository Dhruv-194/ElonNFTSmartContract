# Elon Sample NFT Project


## About 
This project demonstrates a basic ERC721 NFT Smart Contract usage using Solidity, Javascript and Hardhat. I created this to study and understand how I can create different NFT Smart Contracts and deploy it on the testnet. 
The smart contract is deployed on the goerli ethereum testnet and minted to my perosnal wallet address.
